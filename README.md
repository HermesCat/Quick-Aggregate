A news/media aggregate to quickly search through your favorite media.

**Checkout our application!** (https://quick-aggregate.herokuapp.com/)

### What is Quick Aggregate?
Quick Aggregate is a social media aggregate for the user on-the-go! Quick Aggregate allows users to get updates on all of their social media platforms quickly and from a single location. Rather than jumping from platform to platform, users can keep up-to-date on the latest news and on their personal interests in one place. With Quick Aggregate, users can save valuable time while browsing their favorite social media platforms and squeeze even more productivity from their day!

### Installation and Use
No installation is required for use. Simply navigate over to (https://quick-aggregate.herokuapp.com/), create an account with a username and password, and begin browsing your various social media platforms through our application!

To use our application, select the social media platform from the "Search-Type" dropdown menu and enter your search into the "Keyword" field. Once you submit the search our application will display the results on the same webpage. 

We have incorporated a feature that allows the user to save their searches for future use. Users can elect to save certain searches as color-coded buttons and use them to make searches. Users also have the option to delete saved searches.

### Technologies
Quick Aggregate was built with React, Express, Node.js, and MongoDB.

We have integrated the following APIs as proofs of concept:

1. Twitter
2. News
3. Recipes

Currently, users are able to search tweets from their favorite celebrities, get the most recent news on events, or find that recipe for that delicious meal for their next meal.

### Future Functionality & Observations
-Form Validation
-More security
-Cutomizable UI
-Animations for UI manipulations
-Able to search additional social media platforms
-Build out the UI for the media search results
    -Reddit
    -Instagram
    -Facebook
-Add additional functionalities to Quick Aggregate that are available on original websites
    -Twitter
        -Tweets and Retweets
    -News
        -Refine search results
    -Recipes
        -Scrape to have the ingredients

In the immediate future we will continue to build out the APIs we have currently integrated. We believe that our application has a lot of potential. The ultimate goal is to integrate every major social media platform and all of their functionality as well.
